This repository contains 3 stand alone set of data on codes associated with the paper by Saucier et al., 2025. All codes were written to be run in Matlab.

GasVolume.m has material related to section 5.3 A Mechanism for Cyclic Explosive Gas Venting. This code can be run on its own.

The TinyPerm_Grids folder should be downloaded as is. It contains the data from the TinyPerm measurment, as well as the codes used to create the visual grid used in figures.

The Lab Permeability and Porosity Folder with Comparison should also be downloaded as is and kept in its current architecture when running the codes that it contains. Inside, there is data for permeability and porosity lab measurment, as well as codes to plot these data sets both to form figure that were used to analyse the data, as well as to make the final figure displayed in the paper. The New April 2025 folder within it refers to an additionnal set of data that was aquired at a later date than the inital data to complement the first set of data.
